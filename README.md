Description of the data and file structure

Raw Chadian Gum Dataset

1.    Dataset Description

This dataset is derived from from the years 1997 to 2021. The dataset is collected for such a long range of period because reliable sources or websites, except the one we use, do not have the latest data from 2021 onward. The clarity of the dataset used in the analysis, particularly regarding qualitative factors like language and colonial history, helps readers assess the robustness of the conclusions and the challenges conducting business, and tracking long-term trends would also increase the credibility of the findings, making it easier for other researchers to reproduce and continue where we ended. The variables that represent the measure of international trade contain information related to trade values, GDP, distance, language, colony status, trade agreements, borders, and landlock status for various countries across different continents. Since the augmented gravity model is used for data processing, we took logarithm of all the variables, which can be also found attached (Processed Chadian Gum Arabic. Sav).
